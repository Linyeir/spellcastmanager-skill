You can ask me about a summary for a spell. For example you can just tell me: Read me the ruletext for the spell incendiary cloud
I could read you the description text of a spell, if you asked me. Just say Give me the description for the spell Heal.
If you just want to hear the description of a specific spell, you can say Give me a description of the spell faerie fire.
