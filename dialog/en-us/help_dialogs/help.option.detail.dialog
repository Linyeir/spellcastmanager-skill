You can ask me about a specific detail for a spell. For example you can just tell me: "I want some information about the spell fireball" Then i will ask you about what exact detail you want to know and we will have a rather good time.
You could ask about the specifics for a spell by saying: I would like some infos about the spell bless. Just follow my remaining questions and we won't have any problem.
I will tell you about a single detail about a specific spell, if you ask nicely. Just say: Provide me with some Information about the spell shocking grasp.
